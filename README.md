# Towards a Dynamic Bloomier Filter

We edit prosseek's implementation of a static Bloomier Filter (https://github.com/prosseek/BloomierFilterPython) to build our own Bloom-Bloomier Filter structure which uses lazy insertions. We call jayabird's implementation of a Bloom Filter in our code (https://github.com/jaybaird/python-bloomfilter).
